# NextGEMS Hackathon Cycle 4 Project

Template used for this project is adapted from
[this](https://github.com/yoctoyotta1024/GoodSciProjTemplate) template for good practices for
reproducible scientific projects in Python and C++.

## Install
To (locally) reproduce this project simply clone the repository.
```
git clone https://github.com/yoctoyotta1024/NextGEMS_hackathon_cycle4.git
```
You will need to run ``pre-commit install`` but other than that all the necessary packages for you
to run & have fun with everything should work out of the box... If not, please raise an issue on the
GitHub repository.

## Documentation
Some documentation has been set up for this project which you should be able to find hosted online
here: https://yoctoyotta1024.github.io/NextGEMS_hackathon_cycle4/... If not, please raise an issue on the
GitHub repository.

Alternatively, You can build and view the documentation locally. First build the .html files using
Sphinx, then view the .html in your default browser. E.g.

```
cd ./docs && mkdir build && make html
open build/html/index.html
```

Thank you and good luck!
