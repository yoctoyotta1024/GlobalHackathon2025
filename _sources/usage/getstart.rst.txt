Getting Started
===============

Clone GlobalHackathon2025's GitHub repository:

.. code-block:: console

  $ git clone https://github.com/yoctoyotta1024/GlobalHackathon2025.git

and install the pre-commit hooks:

.. code-block:: console

  $ pre-commit install

That's it, you're done! But maybe now you want to customise the project
and push it to your own GitHub repo...
